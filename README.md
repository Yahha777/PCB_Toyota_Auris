# PCB_Toyota_Auris
Scheme and PCB for inverter Toyota Auris 3 in KiCAD format
This is my first time using CAD - I understand that a lot of things are done amateurishly.
PCB assembled, partially tested on 03.12.22. But this version has changes regarding UART ESP-32
The main difference from other Open inverter projects based on Toyota Prius and Auris for dual-motor boards is the use of the WiFi ESP-32 module.
In the /sd-card_adapter_esp32 directory, the diagram and PCB of the connector of the ESP module and micro SD card. (This has not been verified) Forum thread: https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2690
